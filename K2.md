# K2 Automation with GUI (2)

## [itable] [table]

[itable] and [table] are very similar to buffer~. It stores values in memory.
itable, table and buffer~ can be editted by the mouse.
In terms of its 2 dimensionality function and itable are also very similar. if the user give X access, the object outputs the Y axis.

### Assignment 1: Difference

- What is the most essential difference between itable and buffer~?
- What is the most essential difference between itable and function?

### Assignment 2: Step sequencer

Make the [itable] whose table size is 16 table range is 128.
Use a [metro 125] and [counter] object and count the number from 0 to 15 repeatedly.
Feed the number from counter to [itable] and let it output the corresponding Y numbers.
Each time [itable] outputs a number, playback a [snare drum](K2/snare.wav) sound interpreting the number between 0 and 127 as the volume of the snare drum. If the Y value is 0, the sample should be not played.

### Assignment 3: Drum machine
In the patch for Assignment2, load [bass drum](K2/bassdrum.wav) and [hihat](K2/hihat.wav) samples als on to [buffer~]s, add two more itables with the same configuration and create a simple drum machine that plays bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat.

### Assignment 4: Phasing
Create a rhythmical phasing by changing the table size of snare drum to 12 (3 beats) and  base drum to 20 (5 beats).

Hint: modulo (%) and infinite counting may help solving this assignment

### Assignment 5: Melody sequencer (advanced)

In the patch for assignment 4, add one more [itable] to the patch. The table size of newly added [itable] should be set to 16 and table range should be set to 12. Let the [itable] control the pitch of [saw~] between E3 and E4 and play with the drum machine.

### Assignment 6: Probability control
Create a new patch with a button. When the button is clicked, one of three audio samples (snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hat) should be played back with the following probabilities.

- Snare drum: 25%
- Base drum: 35%
- Hi-hat: 40%

Implement this patch by studying further functionality of [itable]

## [nodes]

[nodes] GUI object displays nodes (circles) in a 2-D space and calculate the distance from the node's center and the knob.

![](K2/nodes.png)

By moving the knob (yellow point), [nodes] reports the distance between the knob and the center of each node. If the knob doesn't enter the node, it reports 0.0.

In the following example, [nodes] outputs "0.0 0.71994". It describes that the knob is outside the circle of node 1 but within the circle of node 2 and relatively close to the center of the node.

### Assignment 7: Waveform interpolation
Place three nodes in [nodes] object. Each node represents saw, square, and triangle wave.
By moving the knob, let the user freely mix those three waveforms.
The frequency of mixed wave should be fixed to 440 Hz.

Hint: [rect~][saw~][tri~]

### Assignment 8: Automate the knob movement (advanced)

The knob position can be controlled also programmatically. Implement an algorithm to move the knob automatically.

## [lcd]
[lcd] is a pre-jitter object to process images on Max.
The functionality of object is simple but the object would be sufficient for a simple image to sound conversion. 

![](K10/lcd.png)

### Assignment 9: Getting used to lcd

- Draw something on the LCD object with a mouse
- Draw something on the LCD object with commands such as printoval
- Write a text on the LCD object with the write command
- Load an image onto LCD

### Assignment 10: Mini-UPIC

Study [UPIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPIC) by Xenakis and listen to [Michena Alpha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yztoaNakKok)

In the UPIC system, the X-axis is mapped to time and Y-axis is mapped to frequency. If the cursor detects a line it generates a synthesized sound.

Implement a simple version of this system using LCD and [ioscbank~]. The height of LCD has to be exactly 300 pixel and use one oscillator per pixel.

Hint:
use getpixel message to get the information of each pixel.
