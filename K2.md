# K2 Automation with GUI (2)

## [itable] [table]

[itable] and [table] are very similar to buffer~. It stores values in memory.
itable, table and buffer~ can be editted by a mouse.
In terms of its 2 dimensionality function and itable are also very similar. if the user give X access, the object outputs the Y axis.

### Assignment 1: Difference

- What is the most essential difference between itable and buffer~?
- What is the most essential difference between itable and function?

### Assignment 2: Step sequencer

Make the [itable] whose X size is 16 Y size is 128.
Use a [metro 125] and [counter] object and count the number from 0 to 15 repeatedly.
Feed the number from counter to [itable] and let it output the corresponding Y number.
Each time [itable] outputs a number, playback a [snare drum](K2/snare.wav) sound interpreting the number between 0 and 127 as the volume of the snare drum. If the Y value is 0, the sample should be not triggered.

### Assignment 3: Drum machine
In the patch for Assignment2, load [bass drum](K2/bassdrum.wav) and [hihat](K2/hihat.wav) samples, add two more itables and create a simple drum machine that plays bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat.

### Assignment 4: Phasing
Create a rhythmical phasing by changing the X size of snare drum to 12 (3 beats) and changing the X size of base drum to 20 (5 beats).

Hint: modulo (%) and infinite counting helps

### Assignment 5: Melody sequencer (advanced)

Add one more [itable] to the patch. The size of [itable] should X = 16 Y = 12 
and let it control the pitch and the volume of [saw~] between E3 and E4.

### Assignment 5: Probability control
Create a new patch with a button. When the button is clicked, one of three audio samples (snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hat) should be played back with the following probabilities.

- Snare drum: 25%
- Base drum: 35%
- Hi-hat: 40%

Implement this patch by studying futher the functionality of [itable]
